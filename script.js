// Callstack and Execution context.
// Every browser has Javascript engine which executes the code.
// Promises has three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
// Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations better than callbacks hell.
// If promise is fullfill then it will go to .then() .
// If promise is rejected then it will go to .catch() to handle the error.
// Promises are predefined methods.
